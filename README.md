# terraform-aws-alb-target-group-cloudwatch-sns-alarms

Terraform module for creating alarms for tracking important changes and occurrences from ALBs.

## Usage

**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/pricemethod/terraform-aws-alb-target-group-cloudwatch-sns-alarms/releases).


```hcl
module "alb_alarms" {
  source                  = "git::https://github.com/pricemethod/terraform-aws-alb-target-group-cloudwatch-sns-alarms.git?ref=master"
  name                    = "app"
  namespace               = "lyric"
  stack                   = "prod-us-esat-1"
  alb_name                = "prod-app-alb"
  alb_arn_suffix          = "XXXXXXXXX"
  target_group_name       = "prod-app-tg"
  target_group_arn_suffix = "YYYYYYYYY"
}
```

| name | Name (unique identifier for app or service) | string | - | yes |
| namespace | Namespace (e.g. `lyr` or `lyric`) | string | `lyric` | yes |
| notify_arns | A list of ARNs (i.e. SNS Topic ARN) to execute when this alarm transitions into ANY state from any other state. May be overridden by the value of a more specific {alarm,ok,insufficient_data}_actions variable. | list | `<list>` | no |
| notify_warn_arns | A list of ARNs (i.e. SNS Topic ARN) to execute when this WARNING alarm transitions into ANY state from any other state. May be overridden by the value of a more specific {alarm,ok,insufficient_data}_warn_actions variable. | list | `<list>` | no |
| ok_actions | A list of ARNs (i.e. SNS Topic ARN) to execute when this alarm transitions into an OK state from any other state. If set, this list takes precedence over notify_arns. | list | `<list>` | no |
| ok_warn_actions | A list of ARNs (i.e. SNS Topic ARN) to execute when this WARNING alarm transitions into an OK state from any other state. If set, this list takes precedence over notify_warn_arns. | list | `<list>` | no |
| period | Duration in seconds to evaluate for the alarm. | string | `60` | no |
| stack | Stack (e.g. `prod-us-east-1`, `dev-us-west-2`) | string | - | yes |
| tags | Map of key-value pairs to use for tags. | map | `<map>` | no |

| target_group_name | The name of the ALB Target Group to monitor. | string | - | yes |
| target_healthy_host_count_threshold | A value below which an alert will trigger for healthy hosts in a target group. A value `<=0` will disable the alert. | string | `1` | no |
| target_healthy_host_warn_count_threshold | A value below which a WARNING alert will trigger for healthy hosts in a target group. A value `<=0` will disable the alert. | string | `0` | no |
