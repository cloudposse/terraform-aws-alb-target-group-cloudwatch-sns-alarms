# terraform-aws-alb-target-group-cloudwatch-sns-alarms

Terraform module for creating alarms for tracking important changes and occurrences from ALBs.

## Usage

**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/pricemethod/terraform-aws-alb-target-group-cloudwatch-sns-alarms/releases).


```hcl
module "alb_alarms" {
  source                  = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-alb-target-group-cloudwatch-sns-alarms.git?ref=master"
  name                    = "app"
  namespace               = "cp"
  stage                   = "prod"
  alb_name                = "cp-prod-app-alb"
  alb_arn_suffix          = "XXXXXXXXX"
  target_group_name       = "cp-prod-app-tg"
  target_group_arn_suffix = "YYYYYYYYY"
}
```


## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| alarm_actions | A list of ARNs (i.e. SNS Topic ARN) to execute when this alarm transitions into an ALARM state from any other state.  If set, this list takes precedence over notify_arns. | list | `<list>` | no |
| alb_arn_suffix | The ARN suffix of ALB. | string | - | yes |
| alb_name | The name of ALB to monitor. | string | - | yes |
| attributes | List of attributes to add to label. | list | `<list>` | no |
| delimiter | The delimiter to be used in labels. | string | `-` | no |
| elb_5xx_count_threshold | The maximum count of ELB 5XX requests over a period. A negative value will disable the alert. | string | `25` | no |
| enabled | Whether to create all resources. | string | `true` | no |
| evaluation_periods | Number of periods to evaluate for the alarm. | string | `1` | no |
| httpcode_alarm_description | The string to format and use as the httpcode alarm description. | string | `HTTPCode %v count for %v over %v last %d minute(s) over %v period(s)` | no |
| insufficient_data_actions | A list of ARNs (i.e. SNS Topic ARN) to execute when this alarm transitions into an INSUFFICIENT_DATA state from any other state. If set, this list takes precedence over notify_arns. | list | `<list>` | no |
| name | Name (unique identifier for app or service) | string | - | yes |
| namespace | Namespace (e.g. `cp` or `cloudposse`) | string | - | yes |
| notify_arns | A list of ARNs (i.e. SNS Topic ARN) to execute when this alarm transitions into ANY state from any other state. May be overridden by the value of a more specific {alarm,ok,insufficient_data}_actions variable. | list | `<list>` | no |
| ok_actions | A list of ARNs (i.e. SNS Topic ARN) to execute when this alarm transitions into an OK state from any other state. If set, this list takes precedence over notify_arns. | list | `<list>` | no |
| period | Duration in seconds to evaluate for the alarm. | string | `300` | no |
| stack | Stack (e.g. `prod-us-east-1`, `dev-us-west-2`) | string | - | yes |
| tags | Map of key-value pairs to use for tags. | map | `<map>` | no |
| target_4xx_count_threshold | The maximum count of 4XX requests over a period. A negative value will disable the alert. | string | `25` | no |
| target_5xx_count_threshold | The maximum count of 5XX requests over a period. A negative value will disable the alert. | string | `25` | no |
| target_group_arn_suffix | The ARN suffix of ALB Target Group. | string | - | yes |
| target_group_name | The name of the ALB Target Group to monitor. | string | - | yes |
| target_response_time_alarm_description | The string to format and use as the target response time alarm description. | string | `Target Response Time average for %v over %v last %d minute(s) over %v period(s)` | no |
| target_response_time_threshold | The maximum average target response time (in seconds) over a period. A negative value will disable the alert. | string | `0.5` | no |
| treat_missing_data | Sets how alarms handle missing data points. Values supported: missing, ignore, breaching and notBreaching. | string | `missing` | no |
